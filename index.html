        <p>I am Silas Groskreutz and I am a full stack developer residing in the Madison, Wisconsin area. I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery. I enjoy working with technology and using it to make our lives better. I have previously worked IT roles where I was a ‘jack of all trades, master of none’ and software development was the next step I wanted to take with my career. 
            <br><br>I am always interested in great opportunities. Please contact me via email so we may discuss them.

                This is one of my first projects built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. I used Nintendo as inspiration because, deep down, I am a huge Nintendo fan.

    <section class="about hide">
        <p>I started out in IT in a level one help desk position and grew my career to a senior junior administrator / senior helpdesk technician through a desire to never stop learning. I also worked for a couple managed service providers where I served various SMB clients creating technical solutions for them.
            <br><br>
            My other interests include general fitness and playing video games. I also like taking my dogs for a walk (though due to their combined size, it feels like they take me for a walk). If want to know more about me, feel free to contact me.
